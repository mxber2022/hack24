## How Pari-Mutuel Algorithm Works

The pari-mutuel betting system pools all bets of a particular type into a single pool. Payouts are then distributed proportionally based on the amount bet on each outcome. Here's how the process works:

1. **Collect Bets:** Aggregate all bets placed on the specific event into a single pool.
2. **Apply Deductions:** Subtract the house takeout, taxes, and any other fees from the total pool.
3. **Determine Winning Bets:** Identify which bets are winners based on the event outcome.
4. **Calculate Payouts:** Distribute the net pool among the winning bets proportionally.

   ```
   Payout per Winning Bet = (Net Pool / Total Amount Bet on Winning Outcome) * Amount Bet on Individual Winning Bet
   ```

5. **Distribute Winnings:** Payout amounts are credited to the accounts of those holding winning bets.
